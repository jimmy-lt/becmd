# becmd configuration file
# ========================
#
# General configuration
# ---------------------
#
# The ``becmd`` section accept general statements to configure the behavior of
# the ``becmd`` program. Bellow are listed the list of accepted configuration
# directives.
#
#
# Hosts directives
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# hosts.api_key (string)
#     The authentication/authorization token that will be used in case the host
#     section does not specify one.
#
# hosts.default (string)
#     Default host to which the program should connect to.
#
# hosts.insecure_tls (bool)
#     Globally disable TLS security checks for all remote hosts.
#
# hosts.timeout (float)
#     Globally set maximum host connection time.
#
# hosts.use_cache (bool)
#     Globally control caching for all hosts.
#
# hosts.use_https (bool)
#     Globally set the protocol to use when communicating with the remote host.
#
#
# Logging directives
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# It is possible to change the way ``becmd`` logs messages on the console. All
# logging configuration statements must be prefixed with ``logging.``.
#
# logging.datefmt (string)
#     Date and time format string.
#
# logging.format (string)
#     The overall log message format string. For all available identifiers,
#     refer to the `Python's documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes>`_.
#
# logging.level (string)
#     The minimum severity level of the emitted log messages. One of: 
#     ``CRITICAL``, ``ERROR``, ``WARNING``, ``INFO``, ``DEBUG``, ``NOTSET``.
#
# logging.style (string)
#     The Python's string format style used to build the log message format
#     string. One of: ``%``, ``{``, ``$``.
#
#
# Hosts configuration
# -------------------
#
# Other sections of the configuration file are treated as a list hosts where
# each section describes the connection parameters to a remote Beyond Security
# beSECURE host.
#
# A host section accepts the following keys:
#
# api_key (string)
#     The authentication/authorization token required to make use of the remote
#     host's REST API.
#
# host (string)
#     IP address or host name to reach the remote host. When not given, the
#     host's section name is used as hostname.
#
# insecure_tls (bool)
#     Proceed and operate even for TLS connections otherwise considered
#     insecure.
#
# timeout (float)
#     Maximum amount of time in seconds to wait for a network connection to be
#     established with the remote host. This option accepts decimal values. For
#     example, ``0.1`` seconds is a valid choice of timeout.
#
# use_cache (bool)
#     Whether or not to cache the responses returned by the remote host.
#
# use_https (bool)
#     Whether to use the HTTPS or HTTP protocol when communicating with the
#     remote host.
